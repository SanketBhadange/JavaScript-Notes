Promises and async/await are both mechanisms for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript, but they offer different approaches:

# Promises:

Definition
Promise: In JavaScript, a promise is an object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. It provides a way to handle asynchronous code more cleanly and manage the results or errors that may occur when the operation completes. Promises have three states: pending, resolved (fulfilled), or rejected, and they allow you to attach callback functions to handle these different outcomes.

States of Promise

Made a Promise => Pending State
Promise can be fulfilled => Resolved
Promise can not be fulfilled => Rejected State
Setled => Promise Executed


``` JavaScript
fetch('https://fakestoreapi.com/products/1')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log('Data:', data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error.message);
  });
```

``` JavaScript
let mypromise =new Promise ((resolve,reject) =>{
    const a=7
    const b=78

    if(a==b){
        resolve('they r equal')
    }else{
        reject('they r not equal')
    }

})
// console.log(mypromise)
mypromise.then((data)=>{
    console.log(data)
}).catch((err)=>{
    console.log(err)
})
```

# Async/await:

Introduced in ES2017, async/await provides a syntactic sugar on top of promises.
It allows you to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous-looking style.
The async keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function.
The await keyword is used within an async function to pause execution until a promise is resolved.

``` JavaScript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://fakestoreapi.com/products/1');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log('Data:', data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error.message);
  }
}

fetchData();
```
Choosing Between Promises and Async/await:

Use promises when you need more granular control over asynchronous operations or when dealing with older JavaScript environments that don't support async/await.
Use async/await when you want to write cleaner and more readable code for sequential asynchronous operations, especially when the flow resembles synchronous code.
Additional Considerations:

Async/await relies on promises under the hood.
Both promises and async/await can be used for error handling, but async/await propagates errors through await expressions, making error handling more implicit.
