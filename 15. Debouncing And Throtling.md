In JavaScript, debouncing and throttling are techniques used to optimize code execution when dealing with frequent events, like user interactions. They both aim to improve performance and prevent excessive function calls. Here's a breakdown of each concept:

# 1. Debouncing:

Debouncing delays the execution of a function until a certain amount of time has passed since the last event.
Imagine a search bar where you want to update search results as the user types. With debouncing, the function to update search results would only be called after a specific delay (e.g., 200 milliseconds) after the user stops typing. This prevents unnecessary updates for every keystroke.

# 2. Throttling:

Throttling limits the execution of a function to a certain number of times within a specific timeframe (regardless of how many times the event is triggered).
For example, imagine an event listener for window resizing. With throttling, the function to resize elements would only be called at most once (or a limited number of times) within a specified interval (e.g., every 100 milliseconds), even if the window is resized rapidly.

# 3. When to Use Debouncing vs Throttling:

Use debouncing when you want the function to execute only after a period of user inactivity. This is ideal for scenarios like search bars, form validation, or lazy loading of content.
Use throttling when you want to limit the number of function calls within a timeframe, even if events happen continuously. This is useful for event listeners triggered by rapid user actions like scrolling, resizing, or mouse movements.

# 4. Implementing Debouncing and Throttling:

Both techniques can be implemented using closures and timers (e.g., setTimeout or clearTimeout). Libraries like Lodash or Underscore.js also provide helper functions for debouncing and throttling.
