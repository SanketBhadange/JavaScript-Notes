# Class

In JavaScript, classes are a relatively new addition (introduced in ES6) that provide a syntax similar to other object-oriented programming languages for creating objects. Here's a breakdown of what classes are and how they work in JavaScript:

1. Classes as Blueprints

Imagine a class as a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (data) and methods (functions) that all objects of that class will share.  This blueprint helps ensure consistency and reusability in your code.

2. Creating Classes

The class keyword is used to define a class. Inside the class body, you can define the following:

Constructor: A special method called with the new keyword when creating a new object from the class. It's typically used to initialize the object's properties.
Methods: Functions that define the object's behavior. These can access and manipulate the object's properties.
``` JavaScript
 // Parent class (Superclass)class Person

    class Person {
        constructor(name, age) {
          this.name = name;
          this.age = age;
        }
    
        // Prototype Method
        greet() {
          console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
        }
  
        // Static Method
            static compareAges(person1, person2) {
              if (person1.age > person2.age) {
                return `${person1.name} is older than ${person2.name}.`;
              } else if (person1.age < person2.age) {
                return `${person2.name} is older than ${person1.name}.`;
              } else {
                return `${person1.name} and ${person2.name} are the same age.`;
              }
         }
}

  const person1 = new Person("Alice", 30);
  const person2 = new Person("Bob", 25);

person1.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
person2.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Bob and I am 25 years old.

console.log(Person.compareAges(person1, person2)); // Output: Alice is older than Bob.
```

# INHERITANCE in JS
Inheritance in JavaScript allows you to create new classes (subclasses) that inherit properties and methods from existing classes (parent classes). This promotes code reusability and helps you organize your code better.

Here's a breakdown of how inheritance works in JavaScript:

1. Prototype-Based Inheritance

JavaScript uses a prototype-based inheritance model rather than a class-based model like some other languages. Each object has an internal prototype object that it inherits properties and methods from. When you create a new object, it inherits from an existing object's prototype chain.

2. Creating Subclasses with extends Keyword

The extends keyword is used to create a subclass that inherits from a parent class. The subclass can access and use the properties and methods of the parent class.
``` JavaScript
// Parent class (Superclass)
      class Person {
          constructor(name, age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
          }
        
          greet() {
            console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
          }
  }
  
  // Child class (Subclass)

  class Student extends Person {

        constructor(name, age, grade) {
          super(name, age); // Call the parent class constructor
          this.grade = grade;
        }
      
        study() {
          console.log(`${this.name} is studying hard for their exams.`);
        }
  }
  
  // Creating instances of the subclasses
      const person = new Person("Alice", 30);
      const student = new Student("Bob", 18, "12th");
      
  // Using inherited methods and subclass-specific methods
      person.greet();    // Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
      student.greet();   // Output: Hello, my name is Bob and I am 18 years old.
      student.study();   // Output: Bob is studying hard for their exams.
  ```
