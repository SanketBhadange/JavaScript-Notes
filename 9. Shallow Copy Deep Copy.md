In JavaScript, copying objects involves creating a new object that reflects the original object's state. There are two main approaches to copying objects: shallow copy and deep copy.

# 1. Shallow Copy

A shallow copy creates a new object with references to the original object's properties.
Any changes made to the nested properties of the copied object will also affect the original object, since they both point to the same memory location.
Methods for Shallow Copy:

Object literal: Assigning the object to a new object literal creates a shallow copy.

``` JavaScript
const originalObj = { name: "Alice",
                      address: { city: "New York" }
                      };
const shallowCopy = originalObj;  // Reference copy

shallowCopy.address.city = "London";  // Modifies original object as well
console.log(originalObj.address.city); // Output: London
```

Spread operator (...) with objects:** When used with objects, the spread operator only copies the top-level properties by reference.

```JavaScript
const originalObj = { name: "Alice",
                      address: { city: "New York" }
                    };

const shallowCopy = { ...originalObj };  // Shallow copy

shallowCopy.address.city = "London";  // Modifies original object as well
console.log(originalObj.address.city); // Output: London
```

# 2. Deep Copy

A deep copy creates a new object with entirely new copies of all the original object's properties, including nested objects or arrays.
Changes made to the nested properties of the copied object won't affect the original object.
Methods for Deep Copy

JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))

This approach converts the object to a JSON string, then parses it back into a new JavaScript object, effectively creating a deep copy.

```JavaScript
const originalObj = { name: "Alice", address: { city: "New York" } };
const deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(originalObj));

deepCopy.address.city = "London";
console.log(originalObj.address.city); // Output: New York (original remains unchanged)
```

Choosing Between Shallow and Deep Copy

Use shallow copy when you only need a new reference to the top-level properties and don't intend to modify nested objects.
Use deep copy when you need an independent copy of the object and any modifications should not affect the original.
