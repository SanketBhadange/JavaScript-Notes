The spread operator (...) and rest operator (...) are two similar yet distinct operators in JavaScript that both deal with iterables (like arrays and strings) and function arguments. Here's a breakdown of their functionalities:

1. Spread Operator (...):

The spread operator expands an iterable (array or string) into individual elements wherever it's used.
Common Use Cases:

- **Copying Arrays:** Creates a shallow copy of an array.
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const copy = [...numbers]; // copy = [1, 2, 3] (new array with the same elements)
```

- **Concatenating Arrays:** Merges multiple arrays into a new one.
```javascript
const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
const array2 = [4, 5, 6];
const combined = [...array1, ...array2]; // combined = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

- **Passing Arguments to Functions:** Expands iterable arguments into individual function parameters.
```javascript
function sum(x, y, z) {
  return x + y + z;
}

const args = [1, 2, 3];
const result = sum(...args); // result = 6 (equivalent to sum(1, 2, 3))
```

- **Spreading Objects (ES6+):** Used with object literals to copy existing properties or merge objects.
```javascript
const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const obj2 = { ...obj1, c: 3 }; // obj2 = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }
```
2. Rest Operator (...):

The rest operator gathers remaining elements of an iterable or arguments into a new array. It's often used with function arguments to capture an indefinite number of arguments.
Common Use Cases:

## Creating Functions with Variable Arguments:** Captures remaining arguments into an array.

```javascript
function sumAll(...numbers) {
  let total = 0;
  for (const num of numbers) {
    total += num;
  }
  return total;
}

const result = sumAll(1, 2, 3, 4); // result = 10
```

## Destructuring Arrays:** Extracts remaining elements into a new array variable.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const [first, second, ...rest] = numbers; // first = 1, second = 2, rest = [3, 4, 5]
```
Key Differences:

The spread operator expands an iterable into individual elements, while the rest operator collects remaining elements into a new array.
The spread operator can be used anywhere an iterable or arguments are expected, while the rest operator is primarily used in function parameter definitions.
In summary:

The spread operator and rest operator are versatile tools for working with iterables and function arguments in JavaScript. Understanding their differences and use cases can enhance your ability to write clean, concise, and flexible code.
